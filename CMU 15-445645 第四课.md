# Database Storage Part II

## TODAY'S AGENDA

- Data Representation 
- System Catalogs (如何保存元数据)
- Storage Models  (存储模型：行存储和列存储)

## TUPLE STORAGE

A tuple is essentially a sequence of bytes. 

It's the job of the DBMS to interpret those bytes into attribute types and values.



**The DBMS's catalogs contain the schema information about tables that the system uses to figure out the tuple's layout.**

## DATA REPRESENTATION

INTEGER/BIGINT/SMALLINT/TINYINT 

-  C/C++ Representation 

FLOAT/REAL vs. NUMERIC/DECIMAL

- IEEE-754 Standard / Fixed-point Decimals

VARCHAR/VARBINARY/TEXT/BLOB

- Header with length, followed by data bytes

TIME/DATE/TIMESTAMP

- 32/64-bit integer of (micro)seconds since Unix epoch

## VARIABLE PRECISION NUMBERS

Inexact, variable-precision numeric type that uses the "native" C/C++ types

- Examples: FLOAT, REAL/DOUBLE

Store directly as specified by IEEE-754

Typically faster than arbitrary precision numbers but can have rounding errors…

## FIXED PRECISION NUMBERS

Numeric data types with arbitrary precision and scale. Used when round errors are unacceptable.

- Example: NUMERIC, DECIMAL

Typically stored in a exact, variable-length binary representation with additional meta-data

- Like a VARCHAR but not stored as a string

### POSTGRES: NUMERIC

## LARGE VALUES

Most DBMSs don't allow a tuple to exceed the size of a single page.

To store values that are larger than a page, the DBMS uses separate overflow storage pages.

- Postgres: TOAST (>2KB)
- MySQL: Overflow (>½ size of page)
- SQL Server: O verflow (>size of page)

### EXTERNAL VALUE STORAGE

Some systems allow you to store a really large value in an external file. Treated as a **BLOB**(二进制大型对象 binary large object) type.

- Oracle: **BFILE** data type
- Microsoft: **FILESTREAM** data type

The DBMS cannot manipulate the contents of an external file.

- No durability protections.
- No transaction protections.

## SYSTEM CATALOGS

catalog是关于数据库相关信息的元数据，存放了表名，索引等,通过catalog来跟踪查看schema

A DBMS stores meta-data about databases in its internal catalogs.

- Tables, columns, indexes, viewes
- Users, permissions
- Internal statistics

Almost every DBMS stores their a database's catalog in itself.

- Wrap object abstraction around tuples.
- Specialized code for "bootstrapping" catalog tables.

很多数据库把catalog用另外一张表来保存，大多数数据库会通过schema api把catalog暴露出来，

You can query the DBMS’s internal **INFORMATION_SCHEMA** catalog to get info about the database.

所有的数据库都必须支持他，所有的数据库系统都有自己的快捷方式来得到这些信息

- ANSI standard set of read-only views that provide info about all of the tables, views, columns, and procedures in a database

DBMSs also have non-stanard shortcuts to retrieve this information

### ACCESSING TABLE SCHEMA

> List all the tables in the current database:

```sql
// SQL 92
SELECT *
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE table_catalog = '<db name>';
// Postgres
\d;     
// MySQL 
SHOW TABLES;
.tables
```
## OBSERVATION

The relational model does not specify that we have to store all of a tuple's attributes together in a single page.

This may not actually be the best layout for some workloads…

## OLTP

On-line Transaction Processing:

- Simple queries that read/update a small amount of data that is related to a single entity in the database.

This is usually the kind of application that people build first.

```sql
SELECT P.*, R.*
FROM pages AS P
INNER JOIN revisions AS R
ON P.latest = R.revID
WHERE P.pageID = ?

UPDATE useracct
SET lastLogin = NOW(),
hostname = ?
WHERE userID = ?

INSERT INTO revisions
VALUES (?,?…,?)
```

## OLAP

On-line Analytical Processing:

- Complex queries that read large portions of the database spanning multiple entities.

You execute these workloads on the data you have collected from your OLTP application(s).

不会去更新数据，而是去提供新的信息，试着让这些信息变得有意义

```sql
SELECT COUNT(U.lastLogin),
EXTRACT(month FROM
U.lastLogin) AS month
FROM useracct AS U
WHERE U.hostname LIKE '%.gov'
GROUP BY
EXTRACT(month FROM U.lastLogin)
```

## DATA STORAGE MODELS

HTAP 混合事务分析处理  试着将OLAP和OLTP一起做了

即依然想要提取数据，并且在拿到数据时，并对其进行分析。

什么样的存储模型能够有效地支持OLTP和OLAP

The DBMS can store tuples in different ways that are better for either OLTP or OLAP workloads.

We have been assuming the n-ary storage model (aka "row storage") so far this semester

## N-ARY STORAGE MODEL (NSM)

The DBMS stores all attributes for a single tuple contiguously in a page.

Ideal for OLTP workloads where queries tend to operate only on an individual entity and insertheavy workloads.
