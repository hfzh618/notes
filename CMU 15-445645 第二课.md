# Advanced SQL

## Relational Languages

Users only needs to specify the answer that they want,not how to compute it.

The DBMS is reponsible for efficient evalutaion of the query.

-> Query optimizer: re-orders operations and generates query plan.



Data Manipulation Language（增删改查）

Data Definition Language (通过定义schema来创建表存储数据)

Data Control Language （安全性授权）

also includes

- view definition
- Integrity & Referential Constraints
- Transactions

## SQL History

Structured Query Language

Current standard is SQL:2016

- SQL 2016  JSON,Ploymorphic tables
- SQL 2011 Temporal DBs,Pipelined DML
- SQL 2008 TRUNCATE,Fancy ORDER
- SQL 2003 XML,windows,sequences,auto-generated IDs
- SQL 1999  Regex,triggers,OO

Most DBMSs at least support SQL-92

## today's agenda

- aggregations + group by
- string/date/time operations
- output control + redirection
- nested queries
- common table expressions
- window functions

## Example database

## aggregates 聚合函数

functions that return a single value from a bag of tuples:

- AVG(col)  -> return the average col value
- MIN(col)  -> return minimum col value
- MAX(col)  -> return maximum col value
- SUM(col)  -> return sum of col value
- COUNT(col)  -> return # average col value

将多个tuple作为输入，在此基础上计算某种聚合并产生单个结果。

aggregate function只能用于SELECT 输出结果中。

> Get # of students with a "@cs" login

```sql
SELECT COUNT(login) AS cnt
FROM student WHERE login LIKE ‘%@cs’
```

还可以有下面这两种写法

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM student WHERE login LIKE ‘%@cs’
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(1) AS cnt
FROM student WHERE login LIKE ‘%@cs’
```

写法不同，但是语义相同。

### MULTIPLE AGGREGATES 

可以在单个查询中放入多个聚合函数

> Get the number of students and their average GPA that have a “@cs” login.

```SQL
SELECT AVG(gpa), COUNT(sid)
FROM student WHERE login LIKE '%@cs'
```

### DISTINCT AGGREGATES

COUNT, SUM, AVG 聚合函数支持 DISTINCT

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT login)
FROM student WHERE login LIKE '%@cs'
```
## GROUP BY

Project tuples into subsets and calculate aggregates against each subset

基于某个属性将我们想要的tuple放在一起。即物以类聚。

![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/09/05/wZp5Of.png)
```sql
SELECT AVG(s.gpa), e.cid
FROM enrolled AS e, student AS s
WHERE e.sid = s.sid
GROUP BY e.cid
```

这个sql的意思是先根据cid进行分组，然后根据学生姓名计算平均GPA

>  想要从聚合函数中提取信息，使用group by

## HAVING 

Filters results based on aggregation computaion

Like a **WHERE** clause for a **GROUP BY**

![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/09/05/wZ95C9.png)
```sql
SELECT AVG(s.gpa) AS avg_gpa, e.cid
FROM enrolled AS e,student AS s
WHERE e.sid = s.sid
GROUP BY e.cid
HAVING avg_gpa > 3.9
```

HAVING子句对结果进行一次过滤

## STRING OPERATIONS

所有的字符串都区分大小写。

### LIKE

like is used for matching. String-matching operators

- '%' matches any substring
- '_' matches any one character

```sql
SELECT * FROM enrolled AS e
WHERE e.cid LIKE '15-%'

SELECT * FROM student AS s
WHERE s.login LIKE '%@c_'

```

### funcions

SQL-92 defines string functions

can be used in either output and predicates

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(name,0,5) AS abbrv_name
FROM student WHERE sid = 5333

SELECT * FROM student AS s
WHERE UPPER(e.name) LIKE 'KAN%'
```

### ||

SQL stanard uses || operator to concatenate two or more strings together

```sql
\\SQL92
SELECT name FROM student                        
WHERE login = LOWER(name) || '@cs'
\\MySQL
SELECT name FROM student
WHERE login = CONCAT(LOWER(name), '@cs')
```

## DATE/TIME OPERATIONS

Operations to manipulate and modify DATE/TIME attributes. 

Can be used in either output and predicates. Support/syntax varies wildly… 

>  Demo: Get the # of days since the beginning of the year.

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;      //查询当前时间
//Postgres
SELECT DATE('2018-08-29') - DATE('2018-01-01') AS days 
//MySQL
SELECT DATEDIFF(DATE('2018-08-29') - DATE('2018-01-01')) AS days;
//SQLite
SELECT CAST((julianday(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - julianday('2018-01-01')) AS INT ) AS days;
```

## OUTPUT REDIRECTION

Store query results in another table: 

- Table must not already be defined. 
-  Table will have the same # of columns with the same types as the input.

```sql
// SQL -92
SELECT DISTINCT cid INTO CourseIds
FROM enrolled;
// MySQL
CREATE TABLE CourseIds(
SELECT DISTINCT cid FROM enrolled);
```

把查询结果输出到表格中。

Insert tuples from query into another table:

-  Inner SELECT must generate the same columns as the target table. 
- DBMSs have different options/syntax on what to do with duplicates.

```sql
INSERT INTO CourseIds
(SELECT DISTINCT cid FROM enrolled);
```

## ORDER BY

Order the output tuples by the values in one or more of their columns.

```sql
SELECT sid,grade FROM enrolled 
WHERE cid = '15-721'
ORDER BY grade

SELECT sid FROM enrolled 
WHERE cid = '15-721'
ORDER BY grade DESC,sid ASC
```

ORDER BY的属性没有限制

## LIMIT 

Limit the # of tuples returned in output. 

 Can set an offset to return a “range”

```sql
SELECT sid, name FROM student
WHERE login LIKE '%@cs'
LIMIT 10

SELECT sid, name FROM student
WHERE login LIKE '%@cs'
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 10
```

LIMIT查询的是无序的，需要结合order by使其变为有序的

## NESTED QUERIED 嵌套查询

Queries containing other queries. 

They are often difficult to optimize. 

Inner queries can appear (almost) anywhere in query.

正确的方法是使用join进行重写

> Get the names of students in '15-445

```sql
SELECT name FROM student
WHERE sid IN (
	SELECT sid FROM enrolled
	WHERE cid = '15-445'
)
```

这里的sid查询了两次，需要优化查找方案。

### 操作符

- ALL→ Must satisfy expression for all rows in subquery 

- ANY→ Must satisfy expression for at least one row in sub-query.

- IN→ Equivalent to '=ANY()' . 

- EXISTS→ At least one row is returned.

> Find student record with the highest id that is enrolled in at least one course.

```sql
SELECT sid, name FROM student
WHERE sid IN (
	SELECT MAX(sid) FROM enrolled
)

SELECT sid, name FROM student
WHERE sid IN (
	SELECT sid FROM enrolled
	ORDER BY sid DESC LIMIT 1
)
```

> Find all courses that has no students enrolled in it.

```sql
SELECT * FROM course
WHERE NOT EXISTS(
	SELECT * FROM enrolled
	WHERE course.cid = enrolled.cid
)
```

## WINDOW FUNCTIONS

Performs a "sliding" calculation across a set of tuples that are related. 

Like an aggregation but tuples are not grouped into a single output tuples.

![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/09/05/wZ9I3R.png)

Aggregation functions: 

-  Anything that we discussed earlier  MIN MAX AVG SUM

Special window functions: 

- ROW_NUMBER()→ # of the current row 
- RANK()→ Order position of the current row



```sql
SELECT *,ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS row_num
FROM enrolled
```
![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/09/05/wZ9fN4.png)

### over

The **OVER** keyword specifies how to group together tuples when computing the window function. 

Use **PARTITION BY** to specify group.

```sql
SELECT cid, sid,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY cid)
FROM enrolled
ORDER BY cid
```

![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/09/05/wZ9h4J.png)
You can also include an ORDER BY in the window grouping to sort entries in each group.

```sql
SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY cid)
FROM enrolled
ORDER BY cid
```

## COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS

Provides a way to write auxiliary statements for use in a larger query. 

→ Think of it like a temp table just for one query.

 Alternative to nested queries and views.



You can bind output columns to names before the AS keyword.

```sql
WITH cteName (col1, col2) AS (
SELECT 1, 2
)
SELECT col1 + col2 FROM cteName
```



> Find student record with the highest id that is enrolled in at least one course.

```sql
WITH cteSource (maxId) AS (
	SELECT MAX(sid) FROM enrolled
)
SELECT name FROM student, cteSource
WHERE student.sid = cteSource.maxId
```

> Print the sequence of numbers from 1 to 10. 

Demo: Postgres CTE! 

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cteSource (counter) AS ( 
    (SELECT 1) 
    UNION ALL 
    (SELECT counter + 1 FROM cteSource 
     WHERE counter < 10) 
) 
SELECT * FROM cteSourc
```
